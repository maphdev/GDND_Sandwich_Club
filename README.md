# Sandwich Club

First project of Udacity's Android Nanodegree.

Sandwich Club is an app that provides a list of sandwich and some details about them, such as a short description or the ingredients list.

## Instructions

- Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements display in a sensible way.
- Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.
